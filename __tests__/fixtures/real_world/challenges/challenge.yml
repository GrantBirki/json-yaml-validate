text: |
  Rotate a number given in a specific base by a given amount of digits **to the right**.
  Rotating to the right means: *lower order* (last) digits become *higher order* (first) digits.

  There are three lines of input:
  1. The amount of digits to rotate (non-negative)
  2. The base of the input number (a value between 2 and 16)
  3. The input number in that base

  The **output** should be the rotated number **converted to decimal format**.

  Be careful:
  - The output must not contain leading zeros.
  - The rotation number can be greater than the number of digits of the number.
  - Any base between 2 and 16 is possible, not just "common" ones.
